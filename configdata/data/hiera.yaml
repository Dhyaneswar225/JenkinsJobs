# Hiera.yaml file allows to specify a hierarchy for the order to apply the yaml files. A .yaml extension is automatically added to the name of the files.
# The hierarchy decreases from top to bottom, local.yaml having the highest precedence and <environ>.yaml at the central configuration file location having the lowest.
# The values common to most environments is specified in the lowest hierarchy file which we can overrride in higher hierarchy files with more environment specific values.
